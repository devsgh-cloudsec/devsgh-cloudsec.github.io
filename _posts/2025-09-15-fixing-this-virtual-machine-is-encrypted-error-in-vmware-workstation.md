**VMware Workstation 17.x** introduced a behavior where VMs with an attached **vTPM** may be marked as "encrypted" even if the user did not explicitly encrypt them. If you're seeing a password prompt on VM startup, this guide will walk you through the steps to fix it.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix (Workstation 17.6.1)

<details>
  <summary>Step 1: Backup</summary>

- Make a full copy of your VM folder. Include all `.vmx`, `.vmdk`, `.nvram`, `.vmxf`, `.vmsd`, `.vmsn`, etc.
- If possible, create a checkpoint or ensure you have a working backup of all relevant VMDK files (especially the "flat" or monolithic file).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2: Identify Disk Type & VM State</summary>

- Verify whether your VMDK is a **single file** (monolithic sparse or monolithic flat) or split into multiple files/extents/snapshots.
- Ensure the VM is powered off, not suspended, and VMware Workstation is closed when making file edits.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 3: Edit .vmx File to Remove vTPM / Encryption Metadata</summary>

- Navigate to the VM's folder. Make a copy of the `.vmx` file (e.g., `vmname.vmx.bak`).
- Open the `.vmx` file in a text editor.
- Remove or comment out (with a `#` or rename) any lines containing:
  - `vtpm.present = "TRUE"`
  - `managedvm.autoAddVTPM = "software"`
  - `vtpm.ekCSR = "…"`
  - `vtpm.ekCRT = "…"`
  - `encryption.keySafe = "…"`
  - `encryption.encryptedKey = "…"`
  - `encryption.data = "…"`
  - `vmx.encryptionType = "partial"`
  - `nvram = "…"`
  - `managedVM.ID = "…"`
- Save the `.vmx` file.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Delete Auxiliary / Metadata Files</summary>

- In the VM folder, delete or move aside the following files (if present):
  - `*.nvram`
  - `*.vmxf`
  - `*.vmsd`
  
- Also, remove any snapshot files (`*.vmsn`) if you're okay losing snapshot history. Snapshots can complicate metadata.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 5: If VMDK is Single File & Descriptor Needs Repair (Using dsfo / dsfi)</summary>

Only perform this step if Steps 3 & 4 did not fix the prompt and your VMDK is a **single file** (monolithic).

- Create a temporary VM in a separate folder. Name it so you can distinguish it.
  - Make its virtual disk the same size as your original VM's VMDK.
  - Use the monolithic single-file format (i.e., "Store virtual disk as a single file / monolithic sparse" or "monolithic flat" depending on your original VMDK format).
  
- Download the **dsfok** tools (`dsfo.exe` and `dsfi.exe`).

- In the temp VM folder, extract a "clean" descriptor header:

  ```bash
  dsfo.exe "TempVM.vmdk" 0 1536 Metadata-OK.bin
````

This extracts the first 1536 bytes from the clean (unencrypted) monolithic VMDK.

* Copy `Metadata-OK.bin` into your original VM's folder.

* Use **dsfi.exe** to inject the clean header into your original VMDK:

  ```bash
  dsfi.exe "OriginalVM.vmdk" 0 1536 Metadata-OK.bin
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 6: Re-import / Start VM</summary>

* In VMware Workstation 17.6.1, either remove the VM from the library (if it shows), then open the edited `.vmx` file using **File → Open a Virtual Machine…**.
* Try starting the VM.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 7: Optional: Re-add vTPM if Needed</summary>

If you originally needed TPM (for Windows 11, etc.), and want it back after restoring:

* Go to **VM settings → Hardware tab → Add → Trusted Platform Module**.
* If the `.vmx` file needs it, add back a line like:

  ```bash
  managedvm.autoAddVTPM = "software"
  ```

  *Note: Only do this after the VM is booted, confirmed working, and you understand the consequences of re-adding vTPM.*

### ⚠️ Special Tips / Things to Watch

* If the `.vmx` file still contains `vmx.encryptionType = "partial"`, you **must** remove that line. This entry is new in VMware Workstation 17.x when vTPM is present.

* If the `.vmx` file or descriptor is **truly encrypted** (not just flagged as encrypted metadata), recovery may be impossible unless you have the password/key. VMware’s KB says recreating the descriptor cannot be used for encrypted disk descriptor files.

* Always perform these operations with VMware Workstation **closed**.

* If deleting the `.nvram` file causes issues (like boot firmware or UEFI boot problems), you may need to reconfigure the firmware settings in the `.vmx` file. Add `firmware = "efi"` if appropriate, etc.
