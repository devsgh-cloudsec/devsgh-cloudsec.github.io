Welcome to **DevSGH CloudSec**, a space dedicated to cloud security, DevOps engineering, and infrastructure automation at scale.

### Why This Blog?

As a cloud security and DevOps engineer, I’ve worked on securing cloud environments, building robust CI/CD pipelines, and automating infrastructure across enterprise systems. Over time, I’ve learned best practices, made mistakes, and discovered tools and techniques that work — and some that don’t.

This blog is where I’ll share those experiences.

### What You’ll Learn Here

- **Cloud Security**: IAM strategies, compliance (like SOC2, ISO27001), zero-trust architecture, and securing AWS/GCP/Azure.
- **DevOps & Automation**: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi), CI/CD with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and ArgoCD.
- **Observability & Reliability**: Logging, monitoring, alerting, and SRE practices.
- **Hands-On Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials you can follow along with.

### My Goal

To help engineers like you build **secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud systems** — without the fluff.

Expect new posts every week or two. If you have a topic you'd like me to cover, [reach out on GitHub](https://github.com/devsgh-cloudsec) or send me an email at [devsingh.cloud@gmail.com](mailto:devsingh.cloud@gmail.com).

Thanks for being here.
